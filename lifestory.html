            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          At about noon african time, there was a great rain fall in the
          city of
          Abuja Nigeria on an election day where a new government was sworn in.
          Everyone was scared of the sudden changes and tribulations which left
          many Nigerian citizens in great grif,fear and regret. Most citizens
          testified it was a sign of a bad omen because of how strange and
          sudden
          it all occured in just less than 24hrs. Prices of food stuff
          became unaffordable for the masses life became worst and the future
          became so dark and dozzy. These unbearable conditions led to the lost
          of lifes and properties, kidnapping and fruad became the only source 
          of survival because there was no hope for the youths and the masses
          but its said that the youth are the leaders of tomorrow which turned
          the mind of the masses never to believe in that quote again.
          At exactly 10pm in the night a beautiful woman was rushed to the
          pharmacist by her only son for some medical care tho
          she was ill and diagnosed of maleria fever. After some couple of hours
          she passed away because the health personal refused treating her 
          for some financial reasons then life became meaningless without the
          existance of a mother. The only son of the beautiful woman was
          abandoned by friends and family which made the orphan more stroger,
          dedicated and never to giveup on his dreams. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Few months later, he met a beautiful woman on the green
          app named Priscila who gave
          him every reason to smile again and every reason to be succesful. she
          inspired him, gave him a life and made him believe there is hope and
          light in the future. Most of the masses went on drug pushing,
          kidnapping, fraud to survive the economy of the present government
          because that was the only way for quick cash and survival.
