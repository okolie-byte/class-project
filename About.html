        Our world is made up of so many incredible women, and so many amazing
        changes in our world are
        being made by women who recognize their importance. We are impacting
        lives in great ways. Today,
        I want to remind all of us of how strong we
        are mentally!

        Being a mentally strong woman and a queen
        is not about how cute we look on any
        given day. It is not about being popular,
        and its not about earning the most money. It is about our character,
        great and risky sacrifices being made.
        It is being good examples for others and
        taking good care of ourselves at the same time.
        
        We all have this strength within us, and it is very important that we
        do not forget this. When you are going
        through rough times, such as depression and anxiety, or simply need to
        remember how awesome you are, come back to this blog and remind your 
        self how special you are and the queen you are. i will tell you all
        a true life story about Queen Priscilla who lives somewhere
        far away in downtown
